## About Me
My passion is cybersecurity and Information Security - specifically Threat Hunting/Intelligence, Reverse Engineering, and Digital Forensics. Blue team has had my heart since day one.  
<br>
I love participating in CTFs and just finished top 3 at the Jeopardy-style Meta CTF at Denver's WWHF 2025! When I'm not working, you'll find me with Ghidra and malware analysis books. It's my favorite part of cybersecurity.  
<br>
Currently finishing my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity at Western Governors University and starting a master's program at the SANS Institute of Technology later this year. I spend a significant amount of my free time participating in CTFs and challenges - it's how I keep my skills sharp and learn new techniques.
